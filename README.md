# Hamster Hangout
By Hustling Hamsters

## What is Hamster Hangout?
Hamster Hangout is a simple command line program that provides an interactive “conversation” for users to record various aspects of their day. These are across a range of categories such as: mood, sleep, activities, and more. This app will save these records for users to come back to, compare previous statistics in various categories from previous records,  and provide and positive and motivating atmosphere to make an enjoyable and personalised journaling experience. 

### The technologies we used
We have built Hamster Hangout in C++ with no external libraries, using the Open Source CMake software for cross-platform development. 

## How to use Hamster Hangout
Hamster Hangout can be easily used by responding to prompts given by Hammy (the hamster). These could be numbered for mood rating, or long answer when asked more detailed questions. The command line interface also offers a variety of options for logging, seeing previous records, and getting extra information about the application. All of the users generated journals are stored in their ``Users/Desktop`` path so they are easily able to navigate to them.

## Reflection and Future Development 
Looking back on the development of this app, there are several things that we have learnt and would improve upon in future.

This includes:
* Better knowledge sharing between team members from the get go so that all have a good understanding of the code base. This would save time having to explain aspects of the code base as people tackle different areas of functionality. 
* Testing as we go, so that nearing milestones we don't have to rush to get everything tested. 
* Having smaller deadlines within each milestone so that we can ensure things are on track all throughout. 

Despite this, there were also things that we found to have worked well:
* Our in-depth planning in stage one of this project set us up quite well for the rest of the development process.
* Task delegation between team members based on skill and availability.
* Utilisation of GitHub issues and PRs.
* Consideration of the scope of the project. Our project is relatively simple, allowing us to more heavily focus on the tasks required for the assignment, which were more about the development processes and utilisation of tools than the application itself. 

### Future Development
If we had the opportunity to develop Hamster Hangout further, we would love to include a customisability aspect, allowing users to change things such as colours, font sizes, typing speed, and activities to complete. 

Not only would this make the application appealing to a wider user base, it would also increase the accessability of it. 

As well as this, we would move away from the command line basis of the application. Running applications in the command line makes them inaccessible to casual users, and also limited us in terms of cross-platform compatibility.

However, we do like the text based simplicity of the application, so would keep this idea, but perhaps move over to a web based application. 

In doing so, a wide range of styling and animation libraries would be available to us, which would allow for exploration of cleaner and more consistent animation.
